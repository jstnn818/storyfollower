# StoryNotes (WIP)

This (WIP) Web-App is designed for users to keep track of stories (whether film, television, or book), as they are reading it. In this app, users will be able to register stories unique to their profile, and have the ability to take notes on the story (and in the future, the ability to track individual characters as well as their locations on a map).

StoryNotes utilizes the Django Framework for the Backend, while rendering HTML Templates for the Frontend, with the addition of minor JavaScript (jquery) for Frontend functionality. In terms of styling, the design is provided by the Bootstrap 5 library.

## Available Scripts

In order to start this application, ensure that you are in the root folder, then run `python manage.py runserver`. A user may need to use the command `python3 manage.py runserver`, depending on their python installation.

## Issues & Future Plans

Currently, the Web-App is far from finished, still requiring the implemention of its character and map features. The idea is that each story will have a corresponding map, where characters can be placed upon the map and moved around at user's discretion. This map will help users keep track of both characters and locations as they consume a story.
